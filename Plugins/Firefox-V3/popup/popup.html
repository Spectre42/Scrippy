    <h3>What is Scrippy?</h3>
    <h6>Right click hacks...</h6>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p align="justify"> Scrippy is a Chrome and Firefox browser add-on that stores SQL statements to aid in the testing
        of websites for code injection vulnerabilities.
        Think cheat sheets but all you do is right click for them.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">This tool is made for web developers, to quickly test web sites for basic code injection
        vulnerabilities. You must have a legal right (Authorisation)
        to carry out any testing, doing so without this authorisation can be a criminal offence under local and
        international law. by using this tool you acknowledge the above statement
        and take sole responsibility for your actions.
    </p>

    <p align="justify"> Scrippy dose not replace the need for a more in depth security review by professionals. And is
        distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
